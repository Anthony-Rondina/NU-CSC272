Here are my thoughts on what Objects and Classes are as well as their conceptual differences.

Objects: An object in java in an entity that represents a real world item. It has data or attributes and behaviors known as methods. I’m a fan of star wars so my example of an object is the character “Luke Skywalker” This object would be of the class “Jedi”. Another example would be “Darth Vader”. This would be one object with another being “Emperor”. Both of these objects would share the similar class Sith. However, both of these objects would differ at and or after the moment of creation. They can start out identical and then change drastically over time depending on how they are being used.

Classes: You can think of these like a blueprint or template from which you can make an object. In my example, “Jedi” is the class and has defined structures and behaviors. An example would be lightSaberColor, name, and behaviors could be useForce() and defend(). Classes encapsulate the shared or common properties of objects. In summary, classes are meant to be the basis for mass reproduction. They hold the common traits the desired objects are meant to hold. As well they are define and methods or actions those objects are meant to take in the future.

Differences:

-Purpose: Classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects, they act as blueprints. They can not interact with any other objects. Think of them like the character creation screen in your typical RPG. All characters have eyes, stat and more. That screen is used to create your character would make an object that can later interact with other objects in the game. While objects are instances of classes and take up actual memory.
 
-Usage: Classes are used to create objects. Nothing more. There is no limit to the number of times that you can create multiple objects from the same class. Once an object is created, it can then interact with other objects using the methods defined.

-Relationship: Classes define things while objects are specific instances that hold real data.
