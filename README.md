Here are my thoughts on what Objects and Classes are as well as their conceptual differences.

Objects: An object in java in an entity that represents a real world item. It has data or attributes and behaviors known as methods. I’m a fan of star wars so my example of an object is the character “Luke Skywalker” This object would be of the class “Jedi”.

Classes: You can think of these like a blueprint or template from which you can make an object. In my example, “Jedi” is the class and has defined structures and behaviors. An example would be lightSaberColor, name, and behaviors could be useForce() and defend(). Classes encapsulate the shared or common properties of objects.

Differences:

-Purpose: Classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects, they act as blueprints. While objects are instances of classes and take up actual memory.
 
-Usage: Classes are used to create objects. You can create multiple objects from the same class.

-Relationship: Classes define things while objects are specific instances that hold real data.
